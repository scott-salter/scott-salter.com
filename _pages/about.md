Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Scott, an SEO specialist with 9+ years of experience executing digital marketing campaigns and strategies. 

At Gymshark - a company that reached unicorn status in 2020 - I lead the SEO & Content team to grow organic traffic and visibility across our 15 global websites, including the US, UK and Australia. 

Previously, I have worked agency-side - working across e-commerce and service-based clients - and in the third sector.
