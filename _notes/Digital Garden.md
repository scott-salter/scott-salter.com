title: Gymshark Central Content Strategy
excerpt: How we grew Gymshark's blog platform
---

## What
Gymshark Central is Gymshark's blog and editorial platform, which publishes product, styling, health and fitness content. 

I started working with the Gymshark Central team in August 2022 after the team was moved under my management in the SEO & Content team. 

## My involvement 
Upon starting work with the Gymshark Central team, I set out to switch the focus to more SEO-focused content to support our goal of driving growth in organic visibility. This meant creating less brand-led content and more search-focused content, with a strong focus on evergreen style and workout content. 

## The Impact
I can't share under the hood of my work at Gymshark, so I can't share too much about the results, but I will include the publicly available Sistrix graph for Gymshark Central.
