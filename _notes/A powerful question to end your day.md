*"Did the people I care about most, get my best energy?"*

I can't remember where I found this - I think it was on Twitter, but I like how it forces you to reflect on what is really important.

Becoming a Dad, I've found it difficult to find the balance between family and work. I'm career driven, but family will always come first. However, on days I've found myself absorbed by work, I don't think my wife or daughter have got the best of me. 

This question helps me to ensure they do.
